# Interactive Billboard
## How to Run
- Install Python3 on your machine ([https://realpython.com/installing-python/](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)). We recommend to use python3.6
- Install all required library
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the application (development mode)
```
$ python3 application.py
```
- You're ready to go

## How it Works
The Interactive-Billboard application will receive a voice command and will translate it into text. Then the main program will hit the text to kata platforms NL Studio. NL Studio will detect the intention of user says then it will return the intention. Once the intention received by Interactive-Billboard application, it will map the intention to the right image.

The Interactive-Billboard application can be developed further by adding a slider between images, a voice activated command, and other sensors as well. All in all, here is the prototype developed in the defined time. Cheers.
